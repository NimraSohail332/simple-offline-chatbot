# Simple Offline Chatbot in Python

This project is a basic rule-based chatbot built using Python. It runs completely offline and responds to common inputs such as greetings, questions, and farewells. The chatbot uses simple conditional logic to mimic human-like replies.

## About the Project

This chatbot demonstrates the core logic behind conversational agents without relying on any external APIs or internet connectivity. It is ideal for beginners learning Python and chatbot fundamentals.

Although it is a simple offline chatbot, this project serves as a base for more advanced systems involving Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT. Future versions can integrate LLMs to generate dynamic and intelligent responses.

## Features
