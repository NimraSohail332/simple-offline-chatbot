# Simple Offline Chatbot in Python

This project is a basic rule-based chatbot built using Python. It runs completely offline and responds to common inputs such as greetings, questions, and farewells. The chatbot uses simple conditional logic to mimic human-like replies.

## About the Project

This chatbot demonstrates the core logic behind conversational agents without relying on any external APIs or internet connectivity. It is ideal for beginners learning Python and chatbot fundamentals.

While this chatbot does not use machine learning, it introduces the basic principles behind conversational logic and intent handling â€” which are foundational to more advanced systems like Large Language Models (LLMs). In future versions, this chatbot can be enhanced using LLMs to provide smarter, dynamic responses.

## LLM Relevance

LLMs (Large Language Models), such as GPT or LLaMA, are capable of understanding and generating human-like language. This project can be extended by replacing or supplementing the rule-based logic with an LLM to:

- Provide open-ended, context-aware answers
- Handle a wider range of questions
- Learn from conversation history
- Integrate with tools like OpenAI, Hugging Face, or LangChain

This makes it a strong base for AI-powered chatbot development.

## Features

- Written in pure Python
- No installation of extra libraries required
- Works fully offline
- Easy to expand with new responses
- Foundation for future LLM integration
